## Quick Start
1. Get a YOURLS install up and running.
2. Clone this repo.
2. Move the contents of the `sleeky-frontend` directory to the root of your YOURLS installation.
3. Open the frontend/config.php file and change the values to suit (Remember to setup reCAPTCHA).
*Sleeky frontend is now installed a ready*
4. Move the `sleeky-backend` folder to the `user/plugins/` folder of your YOURLS installation.
